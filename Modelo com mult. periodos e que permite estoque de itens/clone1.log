Tried aggregator 1 time.
LP Presolve eliminated 18 rows and 21 columns.
Aggregator did 4716 substitutions.
Reduced LP has 126 rows, 372 columns, and 1082 nonzeros.
Presolve time = 0.02 sec. (2.94 ticks)
Parallel mode: using up to 10 threads for barrier.
Number of nonzeros in lower triangle of A*A' = 590
Using Approximate Minimum Degree ordering
Total time for automatic ordering = 0.00 sec. (0.06 ticks)
